*** Org babel

Org babel allows you to execute programming languages in line! Here's an example with python.

#+name: py
#+begin_src python :results value
return "Hello"
#+end_src

You can also take these results... and use them in other programming languages! take a look at what we got from the python execution and use it in Javascript.
#+name: js
#+begin_src js :var x=py :results output
console.log(x + " world")
#+end_src


#+name: sh
#+begin_src bash :var pyjs=js
echo $pyjs from the terminal
#+end_src


#+name: hs
#+begin_src haskell :var sh=sh
print (sh ++ " or haskell or whatever. ")
#+end_src


#+name: jv
#+begin_src java :var hs=hs
System.out.println(hs + "I guess java can be here too.");
#+end_src
